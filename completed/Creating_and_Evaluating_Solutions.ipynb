This often means that while your model probably won't be this bad with a customer or on your own data, it does bias the metrics to favor their existing solution. If you work to just push the offline metrics to match or exceed their existing solution you may just be making HRNN start to behave like whatever they were already using.\n",

From there you look to run small experiments with Personalize against their existing recommendation system and see over time how the AB test performs. If Personalize is winning then it is the time to filter more and more traffic to Personalize and campaigns within it. Over time the bias from the existing model will fade."
