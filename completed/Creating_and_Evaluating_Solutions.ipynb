    "# Creating and Evaluating Solutions \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap from the first notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part the algorithms in Amazon Personalize look to solve different tasks explained here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HRNN & HRNN-Metadata - Personalization\n",
    "1. HRNN Coldstart - Personalization that promotes new conten\n",
    "1. Personalized-Ranking - Takes a collection of items and then orders them in probable order of interest using an HRNN-like approach.\n",
    "1. SIMS(Similar Items) - Given one item, what other items are also interacted with by users.\n",
    "1. Popularity-Count - What items are most popular, if HRNN or HRNN-Metadata do not have an answer for the user you query, this is what is returned by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. UserID - User who interacted\n",
    "1. ItemID - Item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. Timestamp - When did this interaction occur\n",
    "\n",
    "We also support event types and event values defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Event Type - Categorical label of an event (browse, purcahsed, rated, etc).\n",
    "1. Event Value - Something corresponding to event type that happened. Generally speaking we look to normalized between 0 and 1 for the values over the types. So if there are three phases to complete a transaction (clicked, added-to-cart, and purchased) there would be an event_value for each phase as 0.33, 0.66, 1.0 respectfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular exercise we will leave event_type and event_value ignored. They can come in handy later but are skipped for the initial POC. \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebooks covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selecting a dataset.\n",
    "1. Preparing interactions data for Personalize.\n",
    "1. Preparing item or user metadata for Personalize [Optional].\n",
    "1. Creating a Dataset Group.\n",
    "1. Creating and importing data into an Interactions dataset within the dataset group.\n",
    "1. Creating and importing data into the metadata datasets [Optional].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "This nobeook will cover creating the following solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HRNN\n",
    "1. SIMS\n",
    "1. Personalized-Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "After that the metrics will be explained and another notebook will showcase how to interact with the Solutions once they are deployed into a Campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to reload the imports and the stored variables from the previous notebooks."
